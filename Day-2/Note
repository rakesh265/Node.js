// Node.js Modules

--> A module in Node.js is a file or a set of files that contain javaScript code that can be reused across in your application.
--> Modules help organize code into separate, manageable pieces, each focusing on a specific functionality.

--> Other js files nothing but modules.
--> which have all different name and different modules.

--> We should include all other modules in a root. we access them using require method

*/  app.js --> require("file.js")



/// we cannot access functions, methods, variables which are in the other modules, with simple require();
    by default modules will protect the functions, methods, and variables from leaking.


// to use them in other modules we have to export the them.




/// Basically, this require method is default js module (common js module --- cjs) 

// import and export. (es6 modules)
--> for using import and export we should a package type module.
--> if the type module present this default cjs does't work, that throws an error.

        we should export the modules functions, variable etc..
        then import tem in app.js to access.
